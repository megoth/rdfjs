<AuthorNote title="My bias with Inrupt">
    I've been straightforward with my bias on the other libraries, so it's only fair that I'm being straightforward here
    as well. I've worked at Inrupt for four years, and have in those years worked with a lot of developers at Inrupt,
    and some of them I recognize as friend to this day. I'm very much biased toward Inrupt as a company.

    I've also used these libraries as part of my work at Inrupt, and have been part of the quality assurance part of it,
    by testing and giving feedback to the developers. Developers who I also communicated with often.

    So I'm very familiar with the various APIs, and although I enjoy working with them, it's not what I'm being drawn
    to currently.
