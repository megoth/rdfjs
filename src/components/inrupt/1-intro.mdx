    [Inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com/) has created an impressive suite for developers who want to work with RDF. They
    currently [offer tools for Java and JavaScript developers](https://www.inrupt.com/products/dev-tools), I'll be
    focusing on the [latter](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/).

    The API is developed using functional programming styles, e.g. you won't be working with a global store, but rather
    passing around objects representing datasets and things in various stages. Most of the code we'll be focusing on is
    from [@inrupt/solid-client](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/), but note that
    there are some other [very useful libraries as
    well](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/api/) (especially the ones dealing with
    authentication).
