        Developer experience is where LDO shines through. By abstracting RDF graph management into what mostly feels
        like normal JavaScript feels like magic. There are some bugs here and there due to its lack of maturity, and it
        can be difficult to dig through some of stack traces when it is involved, but all of this is will pass as it
        matures and the API becomes more stable.

        The documentation of LDO is ok, but can definitely be improved, especially for the more experimental stuff (I'm
        looking at you @ldo/solid-react). But again, this is to be expected for something this new, and given the
        material we have we can expect more to come.

        The community of LDO is a small group of people, with Jackson Morgan doing most of the development. Jackson's
        quite busy, so it can take some time to get bugs fixed, but he's also the kind of guy who'll rewrite most of his
        code because a bug showed a flaw in his old code. If you're in a position where you can give a bug some time, be
        patient, and let it be resolved down the line, then you're good with choosing LDO.

        This is where LDO lacks behind the other libraries. Jackson has been working on it for over a year or so, and
        with limited resources there are lengths to how much you can do. That said, it's impressive how much that's in
        the works for LDO, and how much that already works!

        I know it's a hard sell, but if you're lucky enough to be able to experiment in your work, and possibly having
        to do major changes in the use of APIs a couple of times, then you're good with LDO. I'm going to choose LDO for
        every project I can, and hopefully my customers will agree that it's a risk worth taking.
