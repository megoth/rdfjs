<AuthorNote id="review" title="Should you choose LDkit?">
    I haven't used LDkit enough to give it a proper review (there's an [issue on the GH-repo for
    it](https://github.com/megoth/rdfjs/issues/12)), but my first impressions are positive. I think there's space for
    ORMs when working with Linked Data, and LDkit seems to be a sturdy tool in that regard.

    Without having gone through it's entire codebase, it feels like it's a good combination of reusing existing tools,
    such as [N3](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js/) and
    [rdf-data-factory](https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-data-factory.js), and a relatively clear and simple API for
    the self-baked stuff, and it seems to mix well together.

    To be fair, the demos on this website aren't the best use-cases for LDkit, as they require small bits of
    workarounds. But I imagine it would fall better into place in larger applications.
