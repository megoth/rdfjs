    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

    <CodeStep lines={["12-19"]} title="Setting up LDkit">
        You will probably want to handle the setting up of LDkit differently in your application, but it's a simple
        setup that works for this demo. This way we ensure that the various parts are only created when the module is
        loaded.

        Note that on line 18 we pass `console.log` as the output for logs, which enables us to view the underlying
        SPARQL queries that manipulates the store. In production you would probably turn this off.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["21-24", "33"]} title={<>The <code>emptyStore</code> function</>}>
        In order to ensure that we have the proper state after our underlying turtle change we empty the store. This
        might be useful to you depending on how you handle persistence of your data.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["27-28"]} title="Prepare turtle and model object">
        I want to store any changes to the RDF graph as turtle in `localStorage`. The `useLocalStorage` hook helps me
        with this. I also prepare the `person` variable for storing and handling the model `Person`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["29", "36", "44", "63", "69"]} title="Error handling">
        I keep track of any errors that might occur and pass them to the `Demo` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["34-35"]} title="Parsing turtle and updating model object">
        Using the parser we parse the turtle and load the data into the store. When that's handled we update the person
        state by finding the model object via the `Persons` lens.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["39-41"]} title="Loading state">
        It can take some time to parse the turtle string, so while we wait I show the `Loading` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["45-55"]} title="Updating store and turtle">
        When the form is submitted we update the underlying store using the `Persons` lens. After this we update the
        turtle in localStorage.
    </CodeStep>
