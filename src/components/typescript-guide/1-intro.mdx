    Although not often, sometimes you'll see the use of types in the JavaScript-code on this website. That's because
    it's actually TypeScript that's shown. Although not necessary, I find TypeScript eases my workflow as a developer,
    and I appreciate tools that allow me to elevate types.

    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript, adding additional syntax. By allowing us
    to type our interfaces we communicate to other developers how to use our work.
