    To understand more of what ShEx can do, let's take a more advanced example. This is fetched from my project
    [ldo-solid-profile](https://github.com/megoth/ldo-solid-profile) where I try to work on client-to-client standard
    to describe the data you can expect when working with a Solid profile.

<Code language="turtle" code={shexAdvancedExample} id="ShexAdvancedExample"

    <CodeStep lines={["13-14"]} title="Specifying type">
        We recognize this data by it's type, being either `schema:Person` or `foaf:Person`. We use the `EXTRA`
        token to allow multiple types being used.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["15-16"]} title="Describing name">
        Name is described using `vcard:fn` or `foaf:name`, either is fine, but none is required.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["17"]} title="LDP inbox">
        Solid extends a lot of the [LDP specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/), the ability to communicate
        with users using a container as an inbox. It's using the `ldp:inbox` predicate to describe this (which
        is defined in the [Linked Data Notifications specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/)).
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["18-19"]} title="Workspace related data">
        Solid makes use of the [Workspace ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/pim/space#) to allow users to:

        1. extend their profile with private information using `space:preferencesFile`, and
        2. list their storages using `space:storage`

        An important thing to note here is the cardinality token used for `space:storage`: `*`. This token
        means "zero or more", meaning we need to account for all of these cases in our App (even though most
        users will have only one).
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["20-23"]} title="Solid related data">
        Solid also has its own [vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#) that allow users to describe data
        that is specific to the Solid API.
