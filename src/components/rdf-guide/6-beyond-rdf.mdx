    <h2 className="subtitle">Beyond RDF</h2>

    After RDFs initial standardization in 1999 it has had multiple extensions, and we now have ways of describing
    vocabularies, logical relationships, and infer new knowledge. Vocabularies (like FOAF) allow us to formally
    agree on terms, and with those terms we can make sure that our data is understood by multiple apps. With that we get
    projects like [schema.org](https://schema.org/), maybe worlds largest vocabulary, and it allows us to more easily
    connect data points, as shown by the [Linked Open Data Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/).

    This might seem little, but it opens up for a lot of powerful technologies, such as
    [triplestores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore), [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL), and
    [Solid](https://solidproject.org/). It's inherent nature to the web should make RDF a perfect match for JavaScript,
    a programming language that has had its childhood on the web, and keeps achieving great strides on the web today.
    But there's an inherent conflict with RDF and JavaScript...

    <h2 className="subtitle is-4">JavaScript has no native interface for RDF</h2>

    Unlike JSON that enjoys being a first class citizen, JavaScript simply don't talk triples. So we have to construct
    systems to manage the data as if we were working with a graph, and APIs to interact with this graph, all in a
    language that don't support it.

    Luckily there are heroes out there who have taken on this challenge. And we now have multiple ways of managing our
    data. (And hopefully you'll be able to select which one to choose with help from this website.)
