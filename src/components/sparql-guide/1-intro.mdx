    <h1 className="title">SPARQL</h1>

    This quote from [sparql.dev](https://sparql.dev/) explains SPARQL nicely:

    <blockquote cite="https://sparql.dev/">
        SPARQL is a query language for RDF data. It is used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format. SPARQL
        stands for "SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language". It was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and
        is a standard for querying RDF data.
    </blockquote>

    SPARQL is way to extensive to explain completely, but I'll explain enough to let you follow what's basically
    happening behind the hood of the libraries presented on this website.
